This is a demo for a presentation on Selenium. This script, made in Python 3.5, enters Cookie Clicker and then spams the Big Cookie with clicks.

How-To:

- Clone the repo somewhere
- Execute `get-latest-chrome-webdriver.sh` and download the appropriate Webdriver version

p.s. Do not support cheating on online games.
